### Hi there üëã

![Profile](/images/edgar-profile.jpg#profile)

I‚Äôm Edgar Gonzalez, and I live between Albacete(Spain) and London(Uk), where I‚Äôm a Mobile Developer at Fund Ourselves.

I‚Äôm new to the .NET ecosystem. Previously I was a member of the Spanish Paratroopers Brigade ‚ÄúAlmog√°vares‚Äù VI, where I served as a Corporal first class (2004-2017).

I started programming five years ago, interested in mobile development with C#, and around the same time, I was introduced to F# by Frank A. Krueger using Xamarin.iOS

Why do I like F#? it has a clean and lightweight syntax, is expression-oriented, exhaustive pattern matching, and discriminated unions.
